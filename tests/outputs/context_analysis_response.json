    "key_objectives": [
        "Create a scalable multi-tenant e-commerce architecture that can handle concurrent users and transactions while maintaining sub-2-second page load times",
        "Establish a secure, PCI-compliant payment infrastructure with fallback mechanisms across multiple gateway providers to minimize transaction failures",
        "Build a real-time inventory synchronization system that prevents overselling and integrates bidirectionally with the existing CRM",
        "Deliver a conversion-optimized mobile experience that accounts for 60%+ of traffic with progressive web app capabilities",
        "Implement comprehensive analytics and business intelligence layer for tracking customer behavior, sales patterns, and inventory turnover"
    ],
    "challenges": [
        "Team size of 3 is insufficient for simultaneous development of frontend, backend, payment integration, CRM connectivity, and admin dashboard within a reasonable timeline",
        "CRM integration complexity may be underestimated - legacy system APIs, data mapping, and real-time synchronization can consume 30-40% of development effort",
        "PCI-DSS compliance requirements for payment processing will necessitate security audits, tokenization implementation, and potentially third-party validation",
        "Absence of defined deadline creates scope creep risk and may lead to over-engineering or perpetual feature addition without clear MVP definition",
        "Multiple payment gateway integration requires extensive testing across various failure scenarios, refund workflows, and currency handling which is time-intensive"

    "recommendations": [
        "Define clear MVP scope focusing on core transaction flow first - defer advanced filtering, analytics dashboard, and secondary payment gateways to phase 2",
        "Leverage existing e-commerce frameworks or headless commerce platforms rather than building from scratch to accelerate development with the small team",
        "Establish concrete sprint-based milestones with a target launch date (suggest 4-6 months for MVP with team of 3) to maintain focus and prevent scope expansion",
        "Prioritize payment gateway integration by selecting one primary provider initially with abstraction layer for future additions, and use hosted payment pages to reduce PCI scope",
        "Conduct early technical discovery on CRM integration requirements and API capabilities - consider asynchronous data sync rather than real-time to reduce complexity"
